 * until {@code FLEZHA_BOUNDED_E2E_RELEASE} is present in the environment. The
 * first runner is launched WITHOUT it (so a SIGKILL lands while the operative
 * is mid-chain, with earlier procedures' Entity state already durable); the
 * respawned runner is launched WITH it, so the resumed instance runs to
 * completion. Mirrors the Rust test app's {@code block_until_released}.
